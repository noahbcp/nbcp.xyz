I am a pharmacology / molecular biology graduate student currently completing my PhD in the [Receptor Transducer Coupling laboratory](https://www.rtclab.org/) at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/). My work focuses on the Melanocortin 4 Receptor where I'm interested in unravelling the intricacies of the receptor's pharmacology. Prior to embarking on my PhD I completed my undergraduate studies at the [Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Science](https://www.monash.edu/pharm/research).

Outside of work, I hold dilettante interests in philosophy, menswear, neuroscience, software engineering and whatever other topic I've decided to fixate on for the previous month. I am a big fan of spaced repetition systems and personal knowledge bases ([Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) respectively) and have been exploiting such in my efforts to self teach Chinese Mandarin for the last few years. You can find a Mandarin translation of my website [here](https://nbcp.xyz/cn/). Though I don't have any musical skills of my own, I think quite highly of my musical tastes. I have kept track of *almost* every song I've listened to for the last 5 or so years over on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/noah_salem). I am a big fan of sci-fi and magical realism novels and spend an inordinate amount of time playing fps, 4X and fighting games (Smash).

This goal of this webpage is to serve as a single point where I can share my research publications, host my CV and hopefully begin to post my own writings when I develop the hubris and/or gall to share them. This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and built with the R package [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) using a modified version of the [Hello-Friend-NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme.
